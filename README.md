# Travelers

This project was built with a Rails API and a React/Redux frontend. Users can add destinations with a city, country, and image URL. You can add activities to those destinations as well as add destinations to your bucket-list or to a list of places youâ€™ve been to.

# Motivation

I've been traveling a lot lately so I thought it was the perfect opportunity to build an app for me to use to add destinations to my bucket-list or keep track of the places I've been. 

# To Run The App

With the rails server running (rails s), you can 'cd travelers-frontend' and run 'npm start'. That will take you to https://localhost:3000 or ttps://localhost:3001 if the rails server is running on port 3000. 

# How To Use 

1. You will be on the home page.
2. To see all of your destinations, click 'Destinations'. There, you can add a new destination or click on an existing destination to add activities to it, i.e. Sight-seeing, Beach, etc. Here, you can also add a destination to your bucket-list or to a list of places you've visited.
3. Click 'Visited Destinations' to see the places youve been.
4. Click 'Bucket List' to see which places you want to go.
